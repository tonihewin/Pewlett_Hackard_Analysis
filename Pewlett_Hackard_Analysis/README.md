# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## OVERVIEW:

  The purpose of this analysis is to determine the retiring employees per title, and to confirm if they are eligible to participate in a mentorship program once retired. We used SQL, pgAdmin, and VS code to assist with preparing tables for the outcomes.
  
  ## RESULTS: Deliverable One
  
  
  In deliverable one we used the ERD created throughout with the module as a reference and created retirement tables of employees who were born between 1/1/52 and 12/31/55. 
  
 ### Based on the overall retiring individuals we found:
  
  - Senior Engineers have a high rate of 25,916 retirees
  - Senior Staff has a high rate of 24,926 retirees

## Results: Deliverable Two

  In deliverable two we reviewed the retiree's that would be eligible for the mentorship program.
  
  ### Based on findings for the mentorship program we found:
  
  - Majority of the Senior Engineers are eligible for the mentorship program
  - Most of the Senior retiring staff can assist with mentoring.

  ## SUMMARY
  
    In conclusion, with over 60 % of the senior staff retiring this will require many new roles to be filled, but there doesn't appear to be enough eligible mentorships available to offset the future employees. This will result in the hiring more training staff for new hires.
